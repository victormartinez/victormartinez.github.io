As promised we keep our series of post about Recommender Systems (RecSys). Today we will understand the different techniques and some algorithms.

If you missed the other posts, check them out:

* Part III: Techniques
* Part IV: Metrics
* Part V: Challenges
* Part VI: References and Further Reading

## Techniques
There are many algorithms regarding RecSys. It is possible to group them into two big approaches (or techniques): non-personalized and personalized.

### Non-Personalized
You don't need to use robust and state-of-the-art algorithms to provide recommendations to your users. 


In fact, it is pretty common to see many non-personalized algorithms in a daily basis. 


#### Association Rules
Items that go together; items that are logically connected;

count(A, B) / count(B)
P(A | B)
LIFT ( symetric

#### Statistical
Items that go together; items that are logically connected;

### Personalized
#### Collaborative Filtering
#### Content-based Filtering
#### Demographic
#### Knowledge Based
#### Mobile / Location-based
#### Constraint-limited
#### Time-sensitive
#### Social
#### Hybrid
